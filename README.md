# JavaScript-Advance

A curated collection of exercises completed during the **JavaScript Advanced** course at **SoftUni**.  
This repository demonstrates practical experience with advanced JavaScript concepts through topic-organized solutions and in-code learning notes.

## What this repository demonstrates

- Practical application of core and advanced JavaScript concepts
- Multiple approaches to selected problems (initial, refactored, or alternative solutions)
- Inline learning notes and explanations in Bulgarian that document the problem-solving process
- Coverage of the main topics in the JS Advanced curriculum

## Usage

1. Browse to a folder that matches the topic you want to review.
2. Open `.js` files for pure JavaScript exercises; open accompanying `.html`/`.css` files for DOM tasks.
3. Run pure JS tasks with Node.js or open DOM tasks in a web browser.
4. Read the Bulgarian inline comments to follow the learning steps and reasoning.

## Notes

- Bulgarian comments are intentionally kept, as they reflect my original learning process and thought process.
- Some tasks contain multiple solution variants to illustrate different approaches and improvements.
- Unit testing exercises use common test libraries (e.g., Mocha & Chai).

## Purpose

This repository is intended as:

- a **portfolio piece** demonstrating hands-on JS Advanced skills,
- a **learning archive** preserving the development of solutions, and
- a **reference** for alternative problem-solving approaches.
